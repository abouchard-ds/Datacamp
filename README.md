[Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/home) is a website to learn "*data science*" online with a heavy focus on coding exercises. They offer mainly R/Python courses. I discovered the website while doing the *Harvardx Data Science Professionnal Certificate* because some exercises were coded on Datacamp.

I've used it for 1 year but have now closed my account since they are raising the price to a level I don't think it's worth it. My goal was to code, learn and complement my academic pursuit.

## Summary:
Between January 2019 and January 2020 I've:

- Completed **60 Courses**
  - Which amount for **3507 exercises**;
  - For a total of ~240 hours;

- Completed 3 `Career Tracks`:

## Post mortem
While I did not had the time to fully commit(young children/full-time work/part-time university), I am still pretty satisfied with the experience. This helped me in real life use cases at work and helped me get better grades at university since it is similar subjects.

The pedagogical methodology of the coding exercises is good as they make you progress from simple to complex seemlessly. There is 'effect' isolation where you see the effect of your changes one at the time and then in combination.

All these coding exercises create coding habits which can only come from experience. Even if you never touched a computer before, after 3500 repetitions anyone would be able to code something on is/her own. 

Overall it's a good product.
